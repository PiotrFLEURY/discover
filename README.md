Generated by the [Very Good CLI][very_good_cli_link] ðŸ¤–

An uncovered discovery CLI created by Very Good CLI.

Find every source not covered by tests in your Flutter project.

---

## Getting Started ðŸš€

If the CLI application is available on [pub](https://pub.dev), activate globally via:

```sh
dart pub global activate discover
```

Or locally via:

```sh
dart pub global activate --source=path <path to this package>
```

> ðŸš¨ Note ðŸš¨
> 
> An issue prevents from updating the CLI using local path.
> 
> If you want to update the CLI, you need to remove `.dart_tool` directory before running the command again.
> See [issue 4295](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/issues/4295)

## Usage

```sh
# Scan command
$ discover scan

# Scan command option
$ discover scan --path <dart_project_path>

# Show CLI version
$ discover --version

# Show usage help
$ discover --help
```

## Running Tests with coverage ðŸ§ª

To run all unit tests use the following command:

```sh
$ dart pub global activate coverage 1.2.0
$ dart test --coverage=coverage
$ dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov)
.

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
